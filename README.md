algernon's Atreus firmware
==============================

This is my work in progress firmware Sketch for the [Atreus][atreus], using [Kaleidoscope][ks]. Unlike my [Model01][fw:model01] or [ErgoDox][fw:ergodox] sketches, this one is not intended for daily use, but for playing selected games.

 [ks]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope
 [atreus]: https://atreus.technomancy.us/
 [fw:model01]: https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/Model01-Sketch
 [fw:ergodox]: https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/ErgoDox-sketch

It is a heavy work in progress, with some awful hacks and workarounds here and there. Eventually these will be cleaned up.
